# 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes how businesses acquire new customers uncovering which marketing channels perform best, how costs vary, and where strategy can be optimized for higher ROI and lower acquisition costs.

It combines data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling to generate actionable insights that support marketing strategy and business growth.
💡 Business goal: Optimize marketing investments by identifying the most effective customer acquisition channels and improving cost efficiency.

# 🧩 Business Context

Customer acquisition is one of the most expensive parts of running a business. Without data-driven insights, companies often overspend on low-performing channels.

This project provides a clear, analytical answer to:

Which channels bring the most valuable customers?

How can we reduce acquisition cost (CAC) while maintaining conversions?

What customer segments are easiest to acquire and most profitable?

How can marketing budgets be re-allocated strategically for better ROI?

# 📊 Key Insights (Example Findings)

(Replace with your actual results once finalized)

Paid Search generated the highest conversion rate but also the highest cost per acquisition.

Organic Social had the lowest CAC and strong engagement — a scalable low-cost channel.

Email campaigns worked best for returning customers and cross-selling.

Reallocating 15% of budget from Display Ads → Organic & Email could reduce CAC by ~12%.

# 🧮 Technical Approach
Step	Description
1. Data Collection & Cleaning	Imported CSV data, removed duplicates, standardized columns, handled missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	Visualized channel performance, acquisition costs, conversion rates using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
3. Feature Engineering	Derived KPIs such as Cost per Click (CPC), Cost per Acquisition (CAC), ROI per Channel.
4. Segmentation Analysis	Grouped customers by region, gender, and income to identify profitable segments.
5. Predictive Modeling (Optional)	Built regression/classification models to predict acquisition probability or expected cost.
6. Insights & Recommendations	Interpreted metrics, visualized insights, and summarized business impact.
